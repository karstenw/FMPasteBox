## This is FMPasteBox the OSX FileMaker Clipboard translator. ##


Currently it has only 2 functions:

+ Get the Filemaker clipboard via the "Get Clipboard" button.
 + This loads the xml text into the text field and sets the menu to the received type.
 
+ Put the text field contents onto the FileMaker clipboard.
 + This translates the text field back to FileMaker clipboard format. The target format is set by the menu.
